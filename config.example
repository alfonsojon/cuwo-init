# Settings file for cuwo-init
# ==================================
#
# Make a copy of this file named config
# and edit the variables to your needs.
#

# Name to use for the screen instance
SCREEN="cuwo"

# User that should run the server
USERNAME="cuwo"

# Path to cuwo server directory
# To get cuwo, see https://github.com/matpow2/cuwo
CUWOPATH="/home/${USERNAME}/cuwo"

# Where the worlds are located on the disk. Can not be the same as MCPATH.
# You need to move your worlds to this directory manually, the script
# will then handle the nessessay symlinks.
WORLDSTORAGE="${CUWOPATH}/worlds"

# Settings for backups
# ==================================

# Location for world backups
BACKUPPATH="/home/${USERNAME}/cuwobackup/worlds"

# Where the whole minecraft directory is copied when whole-backup is executed
# whole-backup is a complete uncompressed backup of the whole server folder.
WHOLEBACKUP="/home/${USERNAME}/cuwobackup/server"

# Format for world backup (tar or zip).
BACKUPFORMAT="tar"

# Normally backups will be put in a subfolder to $BACKUPPATH with todays date
# and the backups themselves will have a timestamp.

# Compress the whole backup with bzip2?
# Note that this may not save a lot of disk space since there can be a lot of files
# in your server directory, that are already compressed, but it can slow down the
# backup a bit. This highly depends on the plugins you're using.
#
# For example: The png files generated by Dynmap are already compressed and still use
# a lot of space in your server directory, so the compression ratio of the compressed
# backup will not be very high.
COMPRESS_WHOLEBACKUP=YES
